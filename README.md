# stormbience
A lightning strike generator/visualiser. Click or tap to generate and play one strike. Try it out on github pages: [jamesthwaites.github.io/stormbience](https://jamesthwaites.github.io/stormbience)

The strike shapes are generated using a modified Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly_exploring_random_tree

Each strike tree is then processed to create instructions for rendering each frame of the strike. Graphics are created using Two.js
